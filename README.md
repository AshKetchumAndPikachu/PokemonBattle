# Pokemon Battle!

We are pleased to introduce the Pokémon First Generation Generator. This 
generator is designed to help provide Pokémon fans with information about 
the selected Pokémon character and the best opponent in a battle. We 
created this generator to commemorate Ash Ketchum and Pikachu, who has 
now retired.

## How does it work?
The user must enter the name of the Pokémon in the text box and click 
submit. Important information such as image, name, type, weaknesses and 
best match for the battle will appear on the side of the trainer's screen. 
Nonetheless, a clip will be at the bottom of the screen to support the 
request.

## User Story:
```md

I WANT to know information about a Pokémon and the best adversary 
SO I can win the battle.
